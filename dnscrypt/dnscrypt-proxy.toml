## List of servers to use
##
## Servers from the "public-resolvers" source (see down below) can
## be viewed here: https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers
##
## If this line is commented, all registered servers matching the require_* filters
## will be used.
##
## The proxy will automatically pick the fastest, working servers from the list.
## Remove the leading # first to enable this; lines starting with # are ignored.

## List of local addresses and ports to listen to. Can be IPv4 and/or IPv6.

listen_addresses = ['0.0.0.0:5053']


## Maximum number of simultaneous client connections to accept

max_clients = 5000


## Log level (0-6, default: 2 - 0 is very verbose, 6 only contains fatal errors)

log_level = 2


## log file for the application

log_file = 'dnscrypt-proxy.log'

## Switch to a different system user after listening sockets have been created.
## Note (1): this feature is currently unsupported on Windows.
## Note (2): this feature is not compatible with systemd socket activation.
## Note (3): when using -pidfile, the PID file directory must be writable by the new user

# user_name = 'nobody'


## Require servers (from static + remote sources) to satisfy specific properties

# Use servers reachable over IPv4
ipv4_servers = true

# Use servers reachable over IPv6 -- Do not enable if you don't have IPv6 connectivity
ipv6_servers = false

# Use servers implementing the DNSCrypt protocol
dnscrypt_servers = false

# Use servers implementing the DNS-over-HTTPS protocol
doh_servers = true

## Require servers defined by remote sources to satisfy specific properties

# Server must support DNS security extensions (DNSSEC)
require_dnssec = false

# Server must not log user queries (declarative)
require_nolog = true

# Server must not enforce its own blacklist (for parental control, ads blocking...)
require_nofilter = true

## Always use TCP to connect to upstream servers.
## This can be useful if you need to route everything through Tor.
## Otherwise, leave this to `false`, as it doesn't improve security
## (dnscrypt-proxy will always encrypt everything even using UDP), and can
## only increase latency.

force_tcp = false

## How long a DNS query will wait for a response, in milliseconds.
## If you have a network with *a lot* of latency, you may need to
## increase this. Startup may be slower if you do so.
## Don't increase it too much. 10000 is the highest reasonable value.

## Keepalive for HTTP (HTTPS, HTTP/2) queries, in seconds

## DoH: Use a specific cipher suite instead of the server preference
## 49199 = TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
## 49195 = TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
## 52392 = TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305
## 52393 = TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305
##  4865 = TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
##  4867 = TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
##
## On non-Intel CPUs such as MIPS routers and ARM systems (Android, Raspberry Pi...),
## the following suite improves performance.
## This may also help on Intel CPUs running 32-bit operating systems.
##
## Keep tls_cipher_suite empty if you have issues fetching sources or
## connecting to some DoH servers. Google and Cloudflare are fine with it.

# tls_cipher_suite = [52392, 49199]

## Fallback resolver
## This is a normal, non-encrypted DNS resolver, that will be only used
## for one-shot queries when retrieving the initial resolvers list, and
## only if the system DNS configuration doesn't work.
## No user application queries will ever be leaked through this resolver,
## and it will not be used after IP addresses of resolvers URLs have been found.
## It will never be used if lists have already been cached, and if stamps
## don't include host names without IP addresses.
## It will not be used if the configured system DNS works.
## A resolver supporting DNSSEC is recommended.
##
## People in China may need to use 114.114.114.114:53 here.
## Other popular options include 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1.

## Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for network connectivity before
## initializing the proxy.
## Useful if the proxy is automatically started at boot, and network
## connectivity is not guaranteed to be immediately available.
## Use 0 to not test for connectivity at all (not recommended),
## and -1 to wait as much as possible.

## Address and port to try initializing a connection to, just to check
## if the network is up. It can be any address and any port, even if
## there is nothing answering these on the other side. Just don't use
## a local address, as the goal is to check for Internet connectivity.
## On Windows, a datagram with a single, nul byte will be sent, only
## when the system starts.
## On other operating systems, the connection will be initialized
## but nothing will be sent at all.

## Remote lists of available servers
## Multiple sources can be used simultaneously, but every source
## requires a dedicated cache file.
##
## Refer to the documentation for URLs of public sources.
##
## A prefix can be prepended to server names in order to
## avoid collisions if different sources share the same for
## different servers. In that case, names listed in `server_names`
## must include the prefixes.
##
## If the `urls` property is missing, cache files and valid signatures
## must be already present; This doesn't prevent these cache files from
## expiring after `refresh_delay` hours.
